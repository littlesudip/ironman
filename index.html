      <h1>Tony Stark</h1>

      <p>
	 Anthony Edward Stark Jr., also known by his name as Tony Stark, is a fictional character, a comic superhero appearing in publications from Marvel Comics.

	        <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>
	Anthony Stark is a wealthy Stark Industries Industrialist and genius inventor who created military weapons and whose metal suit is laden with technological devices that enable him to fight crime. Throughout most of his career, Iron Man has been a member of the superhero team The Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. 
	 Stark's armor becomes sentient despite fail-safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so.[63] Initially, Stark welcomes this "living" armor for its improved tactical abilities. The armor begins to grow more aggressive, killing indiscriminately and eventually desiring to replace Stark altogether. In the final confrontation on a desert island, Stark suffers another heart attack. The armor sacrifices its own existence to save its creator's life, giving up essential components to give Stark a new, artificial heart.
